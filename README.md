# The code implements a basic reverse shell in COBOL. 

It creates a socket and binds it to port 4444. The program then listens for incoming connections on the socket. Once a connection is established, the code retrieves the received command from the socket buffer and executes it using the system function. After executing the command, the program closes the socket.

The code can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the target system. This could be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing data or installing malware. Therefore, it is important to use the code with caution.

# The code can be found in the file named 'code'
